GLLAI Datasets is a collection of frozen, versioned, curriculum-grounded linguistic datasets for Ghanaian local languages.

The repository currently includes Asante/Akuapem Twi, Eʋegbe (Ewe), and Ga, each maintained in strict language isolation and versioned independently.

The datasets are designed for:

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Instruction tuning

Linguistic research and language preservation

All data is:

PDF-grounded (no web or inferred knowledge)

Append-only and regression-safe

Built with refusal-first behavior (UNKNOWN responses expected)

Free of cross-language or cross-dialect contamination

This repository contains data only.
Runtime logic, models, and applications live in separate repositories.
