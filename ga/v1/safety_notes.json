    "Follow Ga guide orthography for vowels and digraphs exactly as presented (gaguide_2.pdf, Vowels and Digraphs sections).",
    "Respect tone marking conventions in the Ga grammatical sketch; tones are inherent in each syllable and are marked in examples where needed (Zimmermann, 1858, pp.10–12).",
    "When extracting pronoun forms, use them as examples tied to the guide and avoid asserting them as the only canonical forms if the source shows variation (gaguide_2.pdf, Pronouns section)."
